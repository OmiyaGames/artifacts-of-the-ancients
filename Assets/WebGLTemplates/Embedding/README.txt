This folder is a template that is selectable in the Unity WebGL Player settings.
It's made to be uploadable to any web portals, including Itch.io, GameJolt, Newgrounds, and Kongregate.

If this is an exported folder intended to be zipped for upload, take the following into consideration:
1) Do not zip the "AcceptedDomains" folder.
    It simply contains files used to replace the "TemplateData/domains" or "TemplateData/domains.txt" files.
2) Do not zip this README.txt, either.
3) If you are not using the WebLocationChecker script, you can delete "TemplateData/domains" and "TemplateData/domains.txt".
    They're not needed.
4) If you are using WebLocationChecker, and decided on using the asset bundle file, remember to replace the "TemplateData/domains"
    to the asset bundle that contains the domains you want your game to support.
    The "AcceptedDomains" folder contains some examples you can copy & paste.
    Also, you can delete "TemplateData/domains.txt", as that's for the text option (below).
5) If you are using WebLocationChecker, and decided on using the text file, remember to update the "TemplateData/domains.txt"
    to the domains you want your game to support.
    The "AcceptedDomains" folder contains some examples you can copy & paste.
    Also, you can delete "TemplateData/domains", as that's for the asset bundle option (above).

By default, the "TemplateData/domains.txt" and "TemplateData/domains" files are copies of
"AcceptedDomains/unity-cloud.txt" and "AcceptedDomains/unity-cloud" respectively.
